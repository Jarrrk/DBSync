It was originally built in-house for [GoGreen's](http://gogreen.co.uk) internal build platform but later realized a wider audience may also find this tool useful.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nIntegrating DBSync into a project takes just a few minutes. Start by downloading the latest release found [here](http://betahoster.com:773/Jarrrk/DBSync/tags), inside the archive you will find a example folder, inside will be two files; copy these two files in to the directory of your project and edit `dbs_config.json` to match your database settings. Once finished you can now start adding your SQL statements in to the `dbs_updates.json` file.\r\n\r\nDBSync is a bare-minimum executable, meaning there aren't any command-line arguments (yet). Run the command `dbsync` in any directory where there is a valid `dbs_config.json` & `dbs_updates.json`\r\n\r\nSomething not working quite right? You can enable verbose outputting by setting an environmental variable like so: `export DBSYNC_DEBUG=true`\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n* JDK/JRE 1.6 or upwards\r\n* Sufficient database user permissions (CREATE, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT)\r\n\r\n### Install Instructions\r\nSimply download the latest release and copy the `bin/dbsync` file from the downloaded archive in to your `/usr/bin/` system folder.\r\n\r\nAfter you've moved the file you will want to make it executable using: `chmod +x /usr/bin/dbsync`\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it, see usage instructions.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n* Initial Design - David Hinchliffe & Jack Carlin\r\n* Programming - Jack Carlin\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright 2016 Jack Carlin\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.",
