It was originally built in-house for [GoGreen's](http://gogreen.co.uk) internal build platform but later realized a wider audience may also find this tool useful.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nDBSync is a bare-minimum executable, meaning there aren't any command-line arguments (yet). Run the command `dbsync` in any directory where there is a valid dbs_config.json & dbs_updates.json.\r\n\r\nSomething not working quite right? You can enable verbose outputting by setting an environmental variable like so: `export DBSYNC_DEBUG=true`\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n* JDK/JRE 1.6 or upwards\r\n\r\n### Install Instructions\r\nSimply download the latest release and copy the `bin/dbsync` file from the downloaded archive in to your `/usr/bin/` system folder.\r\n\r\nAfter you've moved the file you will want to make it executable using: `chmod +x /usr/bin/dbsync`\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it, see usage instructions.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n* Initial Design - David Hinchliffe & Jack Carlin\r\n* Programming - Jack Carlin\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n**Copyright 2016 Jack Carlin**\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.",
